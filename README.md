# Data
we work here with tiny subset (128MB) of the full dataset available (12GB)

# Model constructions
1. Create Spark Session
2. Load and clean the dataset, checking for invalid or missing data - for example, records without userids or sessionids.
3. Define the churn
4. Explore tha data
6. Make a feature selection  --- Feature Engineering
7. Machine learning Alogorithm comaprison
    Logistic Regression
    Support Vector Machine
    Random Forest And will calculate the F1score and the accuracy to be compared

# Code
All the code is contained in the sparkify jupyter notebook
